今日茂内さんから連絡が来て6月6日新人の韓国人の人と歓迎会を行うと聞きました。
やはり、リーダーになったら、いろいろ機会が増えて嬉しいね。
たぶん、僕が通訳するだろうと思うけど、なんかドキドキする。
美味しいものいっぱい食べよう。

Today, I received a mail from 茂内 which will have celebration party for new member from korea on July 6th.
I am pleased with having chances which meet other people.
I may translate for him. But I am excited.
I would like to eat delicious foods.
