I am using an app called '말해보카' to study english while working out,and I find it to be helpful.
However, it requires payment, and there are two payment options:
one is 9000 yen for one year, and the other is 900 yen per month.
If I had to choose between the two, I would select the monthly option since I am not certain if I will continue using it for a full year.
